# 6.1.2-Doubly-linked-list-in-C
Implementation of a doubly linked list for storing floating point numbers.

This implementation is used as a reference for assignment 6.1 - Implementation of a polymorphic doubly linked list along with
a polymorhic vector implementation in C and an C++ implementation of doubly linked list with the std::list class template.
In assignment 6.1, the stundent is supposed to create a polymorphic linked list implementation in C by using unions.

See the polymorhic vector implementation in C here:

See the C++ implementation of doubly linked list with the std::list class template here:
